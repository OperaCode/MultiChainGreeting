# Multi-Framework Smart Contract Deployment  
### Hardhat + Foundry → CELO Testnet 

This project demonstrates deploying the same smart contract using **two Ethereum development frameworks**:

- **Hardhat**
- **Foundry**

Both frameworks deploy to:

- **CELO Testnet** (ETH gas)

# Owner Contract - HardHat & Foundry

A simple ownership management smart contract deployed on **CELO Testnet** using both **Hardhat** and **Foundry** development frameworks.

The contract allows:
- Setting the deployer as the initial owner
- Changing ownership securely
- Restricting sensitive functions to the owner only
